update arduino sketch via http
The versioned bin files can be put here and accessed by an arduino using a url such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learnfromgirls/InternetOTA/main/update-v1.bin
The bin files are obtained by selecting arduino preference verbose debugging during  upload to be able to see where the bin file is stored during upload,
or use the "sketch/export compile binary" menu.
e.g. 

/tmp/arduino_build_636349/InternetOTA.ino.bin

InternetOTA.ino.nano_33_iot.bin
